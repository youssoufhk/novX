# Quantitative Finance Tools

This is a code I wrote as an experiment in order to build single discount curves and also multicurves using the discount curve priorly built.

Contributions are encouraged! I have yet to include multiple products for I only used swaps for this code.

## xVA part
I started implementing the xVA computation and I would like to reprioritize my objectives as I am currently on a mission to fully grasp the AAD methods because they are useful for the sensitivities compution in xVA. More contributions in this regard are very welcome.
